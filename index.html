            <h1>Hi, I'm Zacc!</h1>
            <p>I spent most of my life as an athlete, but now I channel my energy into creating awesome things on my
                 laptop! With two years of professional experience as a Full-Stack developer, I've had hands-on experience with every 
                 aspect of developing web applications. In my free time, I love to create games, apps, and websites just like this one!
                 This site is my personal showcase of projects that I've created, and I'm excited to share them with the world. 
                 Whether you're a potential employer, client, or simply a curious visitor, 
                 I hope you enjoy your time here and feel inspired to create something amazing of your own!</p>
